It&amp;rsquo;s an old building, with winding corridors and confusing room numbering. The rooms themselves are fairly basic, but the price and atmosphere more than makes up for it.
The shower is also fairly basic, with a waterfall shower ahead and a traditional shower head below. Rather annoyingly, the traditional shower head operated independently of the waterfall head making it somewhat confusing.</description></item><item><title>Red Lion Farm, Haughton</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/red-lion-haughton/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2024 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/red-lion-haughton/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Environment ⭐⭐⭐ This was basically just a normal home shower, it got hot very quickly and had a great pressure. The shower head was detachable and even had different nozzle patterns, but they were all either a little too forceful or not forceful enough. The cubicle was quite cramped, with no shelf for your shampoo and no place to sit. The shelving was okay, but not really great for storing anything large on.</description></item><item><title>Camping Château du Grandspette, Éperlecques</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/chateau-de-grandspette/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jul 2024 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/chateau-de-grandspette/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐ Environment ⭐⭐⭐⭐ A fairly standard shower setup here, with a push button which also acts as a temperature control. The shower was a nozzle sticking out of the wall with no way of moving it, but the spray was pretty good. The biggest issue here, however, was that there is nowhere to put your shower gel/shampoo. You could only put it on the floor.</description></item><item><title>Le Prahay, Bouillion</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/le-prahay/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jul 2024 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/le-prahay/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐ Mechanism ⭐ This Belgian campsite has a rather confusing shower mechanism. When you enter a cubicle, there is a contactless card mechanism that asks you to present your &amp;ldquo;Camping Card&amp;rdquo;, however, this isn&amp;rsquo;t actually used at all as you just press &amp;ldquo;start&amp;rdquo; and the water comes on for 5 minutes.
The actual shower itsself is just a simple spray nozzle sticking out from the wall, with no method of adjusting the angle of spray which does enroach on the area where you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to keep your towel.</description></item><item><title>Campingplatz Clausensee, Waldfischbach-Burgalben</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/campingplatz-clausensee/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/campingplatz-clausensee/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Environment ⭐⭐⭐ The showers here were some of the best showers I&amp;rsquo;ve come across, with a great range of available heat, a standard and simple mixer mechanism and brilliant pressure. The shower head could have been better but was perfectly acceptable, being a removable head with plenty of length on the hose to move it around.
However, for this place I need to introduce an entirely new category that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had to consider before - the environment.</description></item><item><title>Camping &amp; Ferienpark Teichmann, Vöhl</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/camping-teichmann/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/camping-teichmann/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐ In this German camping site, they use a rather complicated shower branded &amp;ldquo;water &amp;amp; more&amp;rdquo; - which is ironic as the shower can barely manage it&amp;rsquo;s core purpose of providing water.
It&amp;rsquo;s activated with a capacitive touch ON/OFF button which turns the water on for a few minutes after which it shuts off and you need to turn it back on.</description></item><item><title>Mecure Manchester Piccadilly</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/mecure-manchester-piccadilly/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2023 17:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/mecure-manchester-piccadilly/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐ The Mercure is a massive, imposing (and somewhat old) looking building with basic but well furnished rooms.
The bathroom here was more traditional, less like some of the more modern hotels and more like the bathroom you would have at home.
The shower was fine, being a dual bath-shower head type system with a surprisingly good pressure and no problems with temperature.</description></item><item><title>Ibis Nottingham Centre</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/ibis-nottingham-centre/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 17:23:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/ibis-nottingham-centre/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐ The Ibis in Nottingham City Centre is exactly what it says, it&amp;rsquo;s right in the centre of Nottingham. The shower and toilet were all contained in one large wipe cubicle that appeared to be designed to just be sprayed directly with a hose once a guest has left.
The shower was a simple single head with okay pressure and good temperature, especially given that my shower took place at peak showering times it performed flawlessly.</description></item><item><title>Casa Henry Nerja</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/casa-henry-nerja/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 17:23:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/casa-henry-nerja/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Casa Henry is a villa in Nerja, Spain. It has two showers, but for this I will be focussing on the main shower.
A dual head shower with a handheld mounted to the wall and rainfall shower coming from the ceiling. The entire shower booth was flush with the floor with only a piece of glass to separate you and the water from your belongings.</description></item><item><title>Church Street Hotel London</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/church-street-hotel-london/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 23:22:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/church-street-hotel-london/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐ Church Street Hotel is a beautifully decorated hotel in an unassuming part of Camberwell, London which for some reason brings up prescription drug spam when you Google it. Similar to Generator, the bathroom was tiled however unlike there the shower was closed off with a glass door and a basin, like you would expect.
The day I was there was incredibly warm so my idea of good temperature might be skewed, but the pressure was absolutely fine and the shower was perfectly usable other than the mechanism being a little bit annoying.</description></item><item><title>Generator London</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/generator-london/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 23:10:29 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/generator-london/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐ Generator is a hotel for trendy-but-poor 20-somethings offering rooms with up to 12 other random strangers in from around £20/night.
The regular clientele probably only comes back to the dorm to pass out after a long night of drinking in the ground-floor bar. Since my plans for the night were to watch YouTube on my laptop in my underwear I opted for the single room.</description></item><item><title>Arriva Hotel London</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/arriva-hotel-london/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2023 23:00:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/arriva-hotel-london/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐ The Arriva Hotel is situated just 6 minutes from King&amp;rsquo;s Cross station which is about the only redeeming feature except for the price. Trip advisor reviews describe the hotel as &amp;ldquo;very basic&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;like a 60s B&amp;amp;B only worse&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;old and smelly&amp;rdquo;. But we don&amp;rsquo;t care about that, how was the shower?
The shower cubicle was pretty badly stained and had clearly been installed quite some time ago.</description></item><item><title>Yotel Shoreditch</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/yotel-shoreditch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2022 12:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/yotel-shoreditch/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐⭐ &amp;ldquo;Yotel&amp;rdquo; is a rather cringily named indie hotel chain, situated here in the equally cringey district of Shoreditch in London. Yotel focuses on making incredibly tiny hotel rooms feel less cramped than they really are, which they succeed at doing.
The shower in the room was a dual head, with one large fixed head above and a smaller detachable shower head below it.</description></item><item><title>Holiday Inn Express Birmingham</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/holiday-inn-express-birmingham/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 22:34:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/holiday-inn-express-birmingham/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ This Holiday Inn Express is right in Birmingham city centre, and has absolutely no customer parking available. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a parking review, though, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to ignore that.
The hotel seems to have been built around 2016, making it at most 6 years old. Which is why it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the showers in this place are immaculate. The surfaces were so pristine I felt like I was the first person to ever step foot into that shower.</description></item></channel></rss>
