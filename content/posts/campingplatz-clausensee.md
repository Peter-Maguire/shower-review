The showers here were some of the best showers I've come across, with a great range of available heat, a standard and simple
mixer mechanism and brilliant pressure. The shower head could have been better but was perfectly acceptable, being a removable
head with plenty of length on the hose to move it around.    

However, for this place I need to introduce an entirely new category that I haven't had to consider before - the environment.
There is no shower building, but a building with showers inside each of which has a door leading to the outside.
This isn't a problem on it's own, but out of all the showers only a single lightbulb inside the building was working. The
shower also drained directly onto the floor which wasn't sloped enough to stop the water from eaching the area for storing your
belongings.
