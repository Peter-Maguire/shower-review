The York Pavilion Hotel sits unsurprisingly on the outskirts of York city centre. It's an old building, with winding corridors and confusing room numbering.
The rooms themselves are fairly basic, but the price and atmosphere more than makes up for it.   
  

The shower is also fairly basic, with a waterfall shower ahead and a traditional shower head below. Rather annoyingly, the traditional shower head operated independently of the waterfall head making it somewhat confusing.
The water heated up quickly, and was a great temperature. The pressure wasn't great, but it was just enough.
