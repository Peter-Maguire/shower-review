The Arriva Hotel is situated just 6 minutes from King's Cross station which is about the only redeeming feature except for the price.
Trip advisor reviews describe the hotel as "very basic", "like a 60s B&B only worse" and "old and smelly". But we don't care about that, how was the shower?
  
The shower cubicle was pretty badly stained and had clearly been installed quite some time ago. The shower its self was a
fixed head and a single temperature/pressure knob. The head was not adjustable and rather annoyingly was pointed so that half of the
water would spray out of the shower door if it was open, meaning you had to take your chances with the temperature instead of waiting for it to heat up.  

Thankfully, the temperature was pretty good and stayed consistent even at peak times. The same can't be said for the pressure, though.
I stayed on the first floor and the pressure was pretty bad, enough to completely overshoot the shower area and make it's way out of the door, but still
somehow not enough to have an actual impact.
