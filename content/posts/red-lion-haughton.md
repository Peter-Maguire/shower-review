This was basically just a normal home shower, it got hot very quickly and had a great pressure. The shower head was detachable and even had different nozzle patterns, but they were all either a little too forceful or not forceful enough.
The cubicle was quite cramped, with no shelf for your shampoo and no place to sit. The shelving was okay, but not really great for storing anything large on. Overall, given the constraints of the space it was probably the best they could do.
