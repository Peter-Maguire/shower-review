The Mercure is a massive, imposing (and somewhat old) looking building with basic but well furnished rooms.    

The bathroom here was more traditional, less like some of the [more](generator-london.md) [modern](yotel-shoreditch.md) [hotels](ibis-nottingham-centre.md) and more like the bathroom you would have at home.  
The shower was fine, being a dual bath-shower head type system with a surprisingly good pressure and no problems with temperature. The shower curtain was the glass type, however, the seal was broken leading to it being ineffective.
