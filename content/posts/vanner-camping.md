Vanner Caravan, Camping & Holiday Cottages is a campsite the River Mawddach in Dolgellau. It's a small but well equipped campsite with great access to local walking and hiking trails,
although not great access to any amenities. I'm reviewing the campsite showers, rather than the holiday cottages.

The showers themselves are within a small toilet block, they are quite spacious inside with hooks and some even have a little plastic stool.
The shower mechanism was somewhat confusing, consisting of a lever and a knob with any indication of their function having worn off long ago. The lever was stiff, to the point where
I felt as though I might break it. 
The water was a great temperature, although only with the knob all the way to the hot end.

The pressure of the water left a lot to be desired, simply falling out of the shower head rather than having any sort of pressure to it. The head itsself was fixed to the wall at a fixed angle.
