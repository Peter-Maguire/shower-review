"Yotel" is a rather cringily named indie hotel chain, situated here in the equally cringey district of Shoreditch in London.
Yotel focuses on making incredibly tiny hotel rooms feel less cramped than they really are, which they succeed at doing.  
  
  
The shower in the room was a dual head, with one large fixed head above and a smaller detachable shower head below it.
Either could be activated by turning the knob left or right.  
At first I stuck with the trusty detachable shower head, but this soon proved to be a mistake as the detachable head had all the pressure of a leisurely sunday drive.
There was barely enough water coming out to wash with, so I switched to the overhead fixed head which was much, much better.
The temperature was perfectly fine, although took a little bit of time to heat up. The shower mechanism was fairly self explanatory, with a knob for temperature and another one for pressure/head selection.
