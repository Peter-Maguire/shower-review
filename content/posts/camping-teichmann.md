In this German camping site, they use a rather complicated shower branded "water _& more_" - which is ironic as the shower
can barely manage it's core purpose of providing water.   

It's activated with a capacitive touch ON/OFF button which turns the water on for a few minutes after which it shuts off
and you need to turn it back on. Normally, you would occasionally press the button to reset the timer to ensure a continuous
flow of water. For this, though, **pressing the button whilst it was running would turn the water off** so you had to wait each
time for the water to stop, then press the button and start it again. To make matters worse, the capacitive button meant that
trying to press the button with soapy hands didn't work properly half the time.  

Aside from the torturous controls, the heat was also basically nonexistant. I had to turn it all the way to full in order to
get anything, and even then it was barely hotter than it would be straight out of the tap on a warm day.
