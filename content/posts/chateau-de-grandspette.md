A fairly standard shower setup here, with a push button which also acts as a temperature control. The shower was a nozzle sticking
out of the wall with no way of moving it, but the spray was pretty good. The biggest issue here, however, was that there is
nowhere to put your shower gel/shampoo. You could only put it on the floor.
