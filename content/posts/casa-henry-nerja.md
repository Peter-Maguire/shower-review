Casa Henry is a villa in Nerja, Spain. It has two showers, but for this I will be focussing on the main shower.  
  
A dual head shower with a handheld mounted to the wall and rainfall shower coming from the ceiling. The entire shower booth was flush with the floor with only a piece of glass to separate you and the water from your belongings.
The towel rack was also rather inconveniently placed directly opposite the shower leading to a soaked towel if you were to accidentally turn on the handheld. There is also no shelf for shampoo etc.  
  
The shower itsself, however, was great. Perfect pressure and very easy to use. However, the amount of hot water was limited and for a villa that sleeps 6 you soon run out of water.
