Generator is a hotel for trendy-but-poor 20-somethings offering rooms with up to 12 other random strangers in from around £20/night.  
  
The regular clientele probably only comes back to the dorm to pass out after a long night of drinking in the ground-floor bar.
Since my plans for the night were to watch YouTube on my laptop in my underwear I opted for the single room.   
  
The shower was an impressive dual-head system with a handheld shower head mounted suspiciously low on the wall and at an angle making it impossible to use without holding,
coupled with a rainfall shower that dripped incessantly when using the handheld. The shower was not inside a typical shower enclosure, rather the drain was built into the tiled floor abattoir style.
This was a quirky idea in theory, but the practical result was that the water flowed against the insufficient slope towards the drain and over into the toilet area meaning that if you were planning on using the toilet in the next 4-8 hours you would need to bring a towel.
  
The handheld head delivered a modest but usable amount of pressure but was hampered by the fact that it was impossible to use it without coating the sink and stash of dry towels with water.
The heat was usable, but nothing spectacular.
