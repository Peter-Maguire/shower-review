Church Street Hotel is a beautifully decorated hotel in an unassuming part of Camberwell, London which for some reason brings up prescription drug spam when you Google it. Similar to [Generator](generator-london.md), the bathroom was tiled
however unlike there the shower was closed off with a glass door and a basin, like you would expect.  

The day I was there was incredibly warm so my idea of good temperature might be skewed, but the pressure was absolutely fine and the shower was perfectly usable other than the mechanism being a little bit annoying.  
Honestly, probably the most forgettable shower and that's probably a good thing.
