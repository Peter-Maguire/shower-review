This Belgian campsite has a rather confusing shower mechanism. When you enter a cubicle, there is a contactless card mechanism
that asks you to present your "Camping Card", however, this isn't actually used at all as you just press "start" and the water
comes on for 5 minutes.   

The actual shower itsself is just a simple spray nozzle sticking out from the wall, with no method of adjusting the angle of
spray which does enroach on the area where you're supposed to keep your towel. The water was nice and hot and got up to
temperature very quickly, but there is no way to adjust the temperature. There is also no way to adjust the pressure, which is
far too high. The water comes out almost atomised in a way that makes it quite unusable at times.
