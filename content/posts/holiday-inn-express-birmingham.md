This Holiday Inn Express is right in Birmingham city centre, and has absolutely no customer parking available. This isn't a parking review, though, so I'm going to ignore that.  
  
The hotel seems to have been built around 2016, making it at most 6 years old. Which is why it's no surprise that the showers in this place are immaculate.
The surfaces were so pristine I felt like I was the first person to ever step foot into that shower.
The latest in shower technology has been employed here, with an immaculate thermostatic mixer shower with a detachable head.
The pressure was weak at first, but a note on the side of the shower gave instructions on how to increase the pressure, which was easy to dial in to be just right.  
  
The shower did not take long at all to heat up, even despite the fact that I was using it around what I imagine would be peak time.
Again, the temperature was effortless to dial in and stayed consistent. As mentioned, the shower head was detachable and had a decent amount of reach on it.
There was no spray pattern adjustment though, although the original spray pattern was adequate.
