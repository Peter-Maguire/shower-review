The Ibis in Nottingham City Centre is exactly what it says, it's right in the centre of Nottingham.
The shower and toilet were all contained in one large wipe cubicle that appeared to be designed to just be sprayed directly with a hose once a guest has left.  
  
The shower was a simple single head with okay pressure and good temperature, especially given that my shower took place at peak showering times it performed flawlessly.
