This isn&amp;rsquo;t a parking review, though, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to ignore that.
The hotel seems to have been built around 2016, making it at most 6 years old. Which is why it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the showers in this place are immaculate. The surfaces were so pristine I felt like I was the first person to ever step foot into that shower.</description></item></channel></rss>
