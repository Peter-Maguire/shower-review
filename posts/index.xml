Trip advisor reviews describe the hotel as &amp;ldquo;very basic&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;like a 60s B&amp;amp;B only worse&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;old and smelly&amp;rdquo;. But we don&amp;rsquo;t care about that, how was the shower?
The shower cubicle was pretty badly stained and had clearly been installed quite some time ago.</description></item><item><title>Yotel Shoreditch</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/yotel-shoreditch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2022 12:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/yotel-shoreditch/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐⭐ &amp;ldquo;Yotel&amp;rdquo; is a rather cringily named indie hotel chain, situated here in the equally cringey district of Shoreditch in London. Yotel focuses on making incredibly tiny hotel rooms feel less cramped than they really are, which they succeed at doing.
The shower in the room was a dual head, with one large fixed head above and a smaller detachable shower head below it.</description></item><item><title>Holiday Inn Express Birmingham</title><link>https://shower-review.com/posts/holiday-inn-express-birmingham/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 22:34:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shower-review.com/posts/holiday-inn-express-birmingham/</guid><description>Pressure ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Temperature ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Shower Head ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Mechanism ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ This Holiday Inn Express is right in Birmingham city centre, and has absolutely no customer parking available. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a parking review, though, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to ignore that.
The hotel seems to have been built around 2016, making it at most 6 years old. Which is why it&amp;rsquo;s no surprise that the showers in this place are immaculate. The surfaces were so pristine I felt like I was the first person to ever step foot into that shower.</description></item></channel></rss>
